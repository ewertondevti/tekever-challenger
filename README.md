# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This project is a front-end challenge made by Tekever company.

The objective this challenge was to create an application pokéde-based website where shows a list of all pokémon and theirs details like types, moves, abilities and etc...
This application consumes a complex REST API (provided by PokeAPI) [REST API](https://pokeapi.co/).

I added a header where they show two options (Posts and About Me), a logo and a label with the project title as well as some styling using a css pre-renderer called Sass.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or higher

- [REST API by PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

### Quick start

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install all dependencies (listed in `package.json`) required to run the project build.

#### 2. Run `npm start` or `npm run start`

`npm start` or `npm run start` will start the project build.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [localhost] in your browser to view it.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
